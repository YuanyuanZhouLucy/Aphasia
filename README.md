## Background: 
Aphasia is an acquired language disorder that affects the production and comprehension of speech. Speech therapy to rehabilitate aphasia is expensive and not always accessible. People with aphasia may struggle to translate the improvements they make in speech therapy to real world environments.

This app allows users to practice rehabilitation exercises in a variety of different locations without the aide of their therapist. The stimuli displayed in the app is customizable; users can take photos of image and the app will classify  object and generate new exercises.
